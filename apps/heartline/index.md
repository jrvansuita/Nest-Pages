## Collecting and Using Your Data

### Authentication

Heartline offers two authentication options:

1. **Anonymous Login** â€“ You may use the Service without providing personal information. Data will be tied to an anonymous Firebase account.
2. **Google Account Login** â€“ You may choose to sign in with Your Google account. In this case, Firebase Authentication receives and stores Your Google account identifier and basic profile information (such as email address) in order to link Your game data to Your account.

We do not request or store any other personal data beyond what is provided by Firebase Authentication.

### Usage Data

The app collects limited usage information automatically to improve stability and performance. This may include:

- Device type and OS version
- App version
- Anonymous usage patterns
- Crash logs (if enabled)

We use:
- **Firebase Analytics** â€“ to track anonymous usage and app interactions.
- **Google AdMob** â€“ to serve ads, which may collect device identifiers and ad interaction data in line with Googleâ€™s privacy practices.
- **Firebase Datastore** â€“ to synchronize character and stat data across devices.

### Game Data (Characters and Stats)

- Character information (name, description, stats) is **stored locally on Your device** by default.
- If signed in (anonymous or Google), data is stored in **Firebase Datastore**, linked to Your Firebase account.
- Data is never shared with third parties except for the storage providers listed above.
